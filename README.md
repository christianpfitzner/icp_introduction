# icp_introduction
This example illustrates the implementation of the icp algorithm within octave / matlab. 


# Task 1
Calculate the centroids of the two datasets for model and scene. 


# Task 2
Calculate subtract the previously calculated centroid for the model and scene. 

# Task 3
Calculate the change in orientation. 


# Task 4 
Calculate the change in translation. 


# Task 5
Apply the transformation to the scene


# Task 6
You will notice that with a higher number of iterations, the matchin "overshoots" a good solution. Fix this by implementing an additional filter, which excludes point pairs, having a high distance.
